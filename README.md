# jsonToExcel-
parses json file with messages downloaded from telegram into xlsx

telegram lets to export chat history in json format
downloaded file is nemed "result.json" by default

being put to the same folder as parsing.py text messages are written to xlsx (only "from", "date", "time", "text" data)
result .xlsx file name is "{username} result", will be out into th same folder as the parsing.py

why make it? a friend of mine asked for it, but wouldn't disclose the reason. i didn't care for it anyway, 'cause i needed practice
now he doesn't need it anymore, now i'm probably add some filters to it and will be able to mock my boyfriend with "i text you much more than you do"/"you didn't use the word 'love' in our texting for 178 days"
